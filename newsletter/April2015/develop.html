<p class="title_green">Thoughts on being an AASA Regional Representative and Serving on the Board</p>

  Midwestern Regional Representative</b></p>
<p>It wasn't until my first retreat in Madison that I fully appreciated the unique balance of robust content and intimacy that our organization provides. In particular, I found the opportunity to &quot;dive deep&quot; on a small group of topics and actually engage in open discussion about them very valuable.</p>
<p>For the past several years, the West/Midwest and East/South regional reps have teamed together to plan and host our retreats. The planning process consists, well, of a lot of planning &ndash; basically, a mini-version of our national conference. We begin by confirming our guest/keynote speakers and then fill in the rest of the program from there &ndash; leaving plenty of time for interactive, discussion-based content.</p>
<p>The retreats also provide the opportunity to visit the campus of other AASA members. From my own University of Wisconsin to the University of Colorado and, for 2015, the University of Washington (&quot;the other UW&quot;), this experience is totally unique to our midyear retreats and is a great reason in and of itself to attend.</p>
<p>In short, a big part of what makes AASA such a great organization is the way the national conference and midyear retreat complement each other so well. It's really by attending both each year that our members are able to realize the most value for their investment.</p>

  Western Regional Representative</b></p>
<p>Since joining AASA in 2010, I have attended three regional retreats &ndash; in Seattle, Madison and Denver. As Western Region Rep, I have partnered in planning two of these retreats and am looking forward to co-hosting the upcoming retreat (back again in Seattle) with Shaun Hernandez on April 30 – May 1.</p>
<p>As Regional Rep, the majority of my responsibilities relate to planning midyear retreats, as well as some membership activities and involvement in various committees (depending on my interest). Currently, I serve on The Cutting Edge Committee.&nbsp;I have really enjoyed working with academic surgical leaders from around the country who have served on the AASA Board. It is a fun, relaxed yet very well-organized and efficient group of people with a nice balance of seasoned members mixed with those new to AASA. If you are interested in learning more about being a Regional Rep, please feel free to contact me or one of the other Regional Reps (Dan Ott – EAST; Rebecca Napier – SOUTH; Shaun Hernandez – MIDWEST). Or, if you are interested/intrigued and want to find out more information regarding other AASA Board positions, feel free to connect with any of the current Board members for more information. We'd also be happy to discuss in more depth when you come to Seattle or Dallas this Spring!</p>
<p>Board nominations occur every year, which allow any interested member of AASA to participate in the election process for open Board positions. Usually, Board nominations take place about 30 to 60 days prior to the annual AASA meeting &ndash; so this year be on the lookout for information around the end of August or beginning of September. Serving on the Board is a great way to get involved with AASA and provide leadership and support to the various strategic goals around education, communication, sponsorship and website enhancement. This new mobile device-friendly format of <i>The Cutting Edg</i>e is one example of leadership by a current Board member, Megan Berlinger, who serves as Secretary.</p>

</b><b>Southern Regional Representative</b></p>
<p>As the Southern Representative for the past four years, I've co-planned the regional retreats during that time. I really enjoy the midyear retreats. The smaller meeting provides a great opportunity for individuals to participate in a much larger way. The more intimate setting also allows for greater networking with the participants. My introduction to the AASA occurred during a regional meeting. I believe that made my experience at the annual conference more enjoyable. I was able to build on networking and relationships that began in a smaller setting.</p>
<p>As for the AASA overall, I find the organization invaluable. Last year I relocated to UT Southwestern after being at the University of Kentucky for almost 18 years. The connections I have through the AASA made that transition much easier. I have a wonderful support network of colleagues who really understand the challenges of the job and provide me a work family that exists regardless of where I am employed. This fabulous group is always glad to provide professional or emotional support, as we all face complex issues in our industries and ever-challenging work-life balance.</p>
<p>If you haven't taken full advantage of being a member of this great organization, I strongly encourage your to do so. Please join us in Dallas for another great AASA experience!</p>

  Eastern Regional Representative</b></p>
<p>I was hired at Yale in May of 2011 by Fred Borrelli, AASA President in 2011. A week into getting the lay of the land in my new position, Fred said &ldquo;you need to join the AASA and attend the Annual Conference in San Francisco.&rdquo; From there it&rsquo;s been a wonderful ride! I attended that first conference in 2011 and my AASA buddy, Meghan Jensen, from Oregon Health and Sciences was my &ldquo;buddy&rdquo; or &ldquo;mentor&rdquo; for the conference. I met a lot of great people and got involved right away.</p>
<p>I became a planning committee member in 2012 and helped plan the Celia King Dinner for the Chicago conference and also coordinate the poster presentations that we currently have at our conferences. I also ran for a position on the board in 2013 but lost by two votes to the incumbent, John Hundt, now the 2015 AASA President. I received a call from Jamie Meyers, the 2014 President, shortly after the election telling me not to be discouraged but keep being involved. I ran again for 2014 and have been the Eastern Region Rep for two years now. I helped plan my first regional retreat in Nashville in 2014 with my South Region Rep, Rebecca, and the folks at Vanderbilt. 015 is no different, as Rebecca and I have planned the midyear retreat in Dallas. Hope you can join us!!</p>
<p>I work closely with Kira Martin, West Rep, and Shaun Hernandez, Midwest Rep, as well as Rebecca in South. We help get people involved and help our membership navigate the waters! The best part is we develop many friendships along the way that last a lifetime!</p>
<p>As you can see, you meet a lot of people and get to do many things as part of the AASA. You get to showcase your talents and be part of a great organization. Think about getting involved, become a committee member and learn the ropes. Be bold and run for a board position; it won&rsquo;t disappoint! I personally guarantee it!</p>
<p>You could say this the AASA is like March Madness &ndash; we&rsquo;ve got folks from schools all over the country &ndash; all competing to be the best! There are no winners or losers what we do at the AASA, but bonds that help us all succeed!</p>
