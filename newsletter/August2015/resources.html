<p class="title_blue">Merritt Hawkins Survey of Physicians Completing Training</p>
<p><img src="images/merritt_hawkins_logo384px.png" alt="Merritt Hawkins" title="Merritt Hawkins" width="384" class="innerWidth" /></p>
<p class="title_black">  Survey: It’s a Buyer’s Job Market for Newly Trained Physicians</p>
<p><b>Bo Burdette</b></p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s economy, most college or training program graduates struggle to find a job in their fields.</p>
<p>For physicians, by contrast, the difficulty is not finding a job, but selecting the right job from a variety of opportunities. That is one conclusion of Merritt Hawkins&rsquo; <i>2015 Survey of Final-Year Medical Residents</i>.</p>
<p>Released in January, the survey examines the career plans and preferences of physicians about to enter their first professional practice. The survey found that physicians completing their training in 2014 were inundated with recruiting offers. Over 60 percent of 2014 final-year medical residents received 50 or more job solicitations during their training, while 46 percent received 100 or more job solicitations.</p>
<p>The survey included responses from over 1,200 medical residents about to complete their training and enter the job market. Residents were asked how many times in the course of their training they had been contacted by recruiters seeking to interest them in job opportunities, either by telephone, email or regular mail. Sixty-two percent said that they had received 50 or more job solicitations during the course of their training, while 46 percent said they had received 100 or more job solicitations.</p>
<p>Despite a favorable job market, however, some new doctors are unhappy about their choice of a profession, the survey indicates. New doctors were asked in the survey if they would study medicine if they had their education to do over again, or if they would select another field. One in four (25 percent) said they would select another field.</p>
<p>The survey also conveys some unfortunate news for rural areas, which traditionally have had a hard time attracting newly trained physicians. Only three percent of doctors surveyed said they would prefer to practice in communities of 25,000 people or less. In addition, only two percent of physicians said they would prefer a solo practice, while 68 percent said they would prefer to be employed by a hospital, medical group or outpatient clinic.</p>
<p>Timing also is an important issue when recruiting medical residents, the survey indicates. Sixty-eight percent of residents said they begin an active job search one year or more before the end of their training, while the remaining 32 percent wait until the last 12 months.</p>
<p>When it comes to what they look for in a practice, residents express a strong interest in &ldquo;lifestyle.&rdquo; Lifestyle largely is defined by residents as the availability of free time. When asked what their biggest concern is about entering their first practice, &ldquo;lack of free time&rdquo; topped the list.</p>
<p>The overall margin of error of the survey is +/- 2.81% as determined by statistical response experts at the University of Tennessee.</p>
