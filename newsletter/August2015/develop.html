<p class="title_green">Book Review: Let Me Heal</p>

<p class="subtitle_black">Book Review by John Hundt</p>

<p>Kenneth M. Ludmerer&rsquo;s new book <i>Let Me Heal: The Opportunity to Preserve Excellence in American Medicine</i> (Oxford University Press, 2015) tells the story of the development of residency training in the United States from the 1890s to the current day. I highly recommend it to you.</p>
<p>It is full of personal anecdotes from residents, faculty and other observers of American medicine. A large part of the book recounts the golden years of residency training. The deep sacrifices that residents made were more than worth it in exchange for the instruction, mentorship, loyalty, shared culture, independence, and joy in work done well. In general, residents during this golden age are portrayed as very happy. They often lived in the hospitals, put off marriage, accepted zero or very little pay and worked exhaustive hours.</p>
<p>Ludmerer describes how many of the larger societal trends have had an impact on residency training. The proliferation of subspecialization, advances in medical technology, the rise of health insurance, changing incentives for medical faculty, world wars, and Vietnam are a few of the many factors driving change in residency training.</p>
<p>Until only a few decades ago, so much of residency training was based on access to charity wards in large teaching hospitals. There was a social compact that the poor and uninsured would receive excellent care driven by residents. The care was usually excellent but the two-tiered system of charity patients cared for by residents and &ldquo;private&rdquo; patients in another system was not sustainable. The rise of Medicare and Medicaid, the civil rights movement and the trend toward consumerism all served to dismantle this system of education underpinned by charity care.</p>
<p>Administrators are often portrayed as the bad guy (mostly deservingly). Residents were too often seen as sources of cheap labor for hospitals. The change of our largest teaching hospitals from their roots emphasizing training of doctors to today&rsquo;s world of competing for patients and emphasizing volume and throughput won&rsquo;t be reversed and had irreparable consequences for training.</p>
<p>Administrators are not the only group with which fault is found. Over the years, senior faculty have spent less and less time with residents leading to charges of &ldquo;physical and emotional abandonment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disillusionment, burnout, and attempts at unionization are all factors that Ludmerer discusses. Call for accountability and reform in medical training led the imposition of work hour rules that we are all dealing with now. Other reforms in training have improved things on the margins. Blatant exploitation and excessive service requirements are not accepted practice any more.</p>
<p>There is also much discussion about the impact of residency training on the cost of health care and the obligations of the medical profession to take more responsibility for this. The book ends with a discussion about the need for new models of training for today&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>Ludmerer, a professor of medicine and history from Washington University, has two other books on the history of medical education in the United States: <i>Learning to Heal: The Development of American Medical Education</i> (January 1, 1985) and <i>Time to Heal: American Medical Education from the Turn of the Century to the Era of Managed Care</i> (January 27, 2005). I enjoyed <i>Let Me Heal</i> so much that I have ordered the other two.</p>
